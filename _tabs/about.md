## Research Experience
### Experimental Skills
- Utilize ultra - high vacuum molecular beam epitaxy (UHV - MBE) to deposit pre - designed precursors on single - crystal surfaces for atomic - scale precise surface construction of graphene nanomaterials. Conduct research on surface molecular self - assembly, surface organic reactions, and the preparation of graphene nanoribbons/nanographenes.
- Operate a bond - resolved non - contact atomic force microscope (nc - AFM) based on a qPlus force sensor, including the preparation of qPlus sensor tips,, constant - height frequency shift imaging of single chemical bonds, piconewton - resolution short - range force measurement, and single - molecule manipulation.
- Study and manipulate electronic structures and magnetism through a low - temperature scanning tunneling microscope (LT - STM). Be proficient in obtaining and maintaining liquid helium/liquid nitrogen low - temperature environments, constant - current feedback STM imaging, differential conductance spectroscopy/mapping measurement, and bond - resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (BRSTM) techniques.
- Install, use, and maintain an ultra - high vacuum low - temperature scanning tunneling microscope/non - contact atomic force microscope - molecular beam epitaxy system (UHV - LT - STM/nc - AFM - MBE). Have experience in installing new systems and have worked on three Createc LT - STM/nc - AFM systems.

### Research Fields
- Use S = 1/2 diaza - HBC as a building block to prepare one - dimensional spin chains through surface synthesis. Employ a 4.5K scanning tunneling microscope and spectroscopy techniques to demonstrate length - dependent magnetic excitations in two types of spin chains at the atomic scale.
- Synthesize NBN - doped zigzag graphene nanoribbons (NBN - 8 - ZGNR) using pre - designed precursors provided by the professor's team. Bond - resolved nc - AFM imaging confirms the presence of zigzag edges and NBN dopants. After inserting a silicon layer at the interface between NBN - 8 - ZGNR and Au (111), reveal the electronic state distribution along the zigzag edges.
- Collaborate with the professor's team to synthesize 9 - AGNR/cGNR heterojunctions on the Au(111) surface through surface - assisted cyclodehydrogenation and substrate - assisted direct (MAD) transfer techniques. Optimize the experimental process, and the formation of this graphene nanoribbon heterojunction structure is clearly confirmed by STM.
